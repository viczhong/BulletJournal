# Bullet Journal

What is a [bullet journal](http://bulletjournal.com/)?

Long story short, it's a combo of a To-Do list, a planner, and a journal.

This app stores your entries to the internet via Firebase so you can login with any iDevice.

### Install

Use `pod install` in terminal and that should do the trick. Open the `.xcworkspace` file after that.
